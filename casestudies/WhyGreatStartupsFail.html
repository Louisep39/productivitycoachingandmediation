						</DIV>

						A promising startup was crumbling. They'd had to spend money they didn't have to settle a lawsuit, their main client was
						three months past due on an important invoice, and the two principals weren't talking to each other. Nearly three years
						of hard work, investment from friends, family, and an angel investor, and a promising software product seemed ready to
						crash and burn.<P>

						<H2>Jim and Simon and the company's bright beginning</H2>

						Jim, a programmer, and Simon, a graphic designer, met while working on internal website projects at the company where
						they'd previously worked. When they were both let go in a major round of downsizing, they jumped at the chance to realize
						their dreams of starting their own company. Both of them hating to commute, they created mobile apps for crowd sourcing
						of real-time information about traffic problems.<P>

						With hard work and an angel investor, they grew their company during a difficult economy. Now, having 22 employees and a
						solid client base, they were doing well enough to attract venture capital investment.<P>

						<H2>Then came the lawsuit</H2>

						Jim and Simon's previous employer filed suit against them for violating the noncompete clause of their employment
						contracts. It turned out that their previous employer was still working with one of Jim and Simon's new clients. Settling
						the lawsuit and paying attorney's fees took capital they didn't have. Simon ripped into Jim for dropping the ball as CEO.
						Jim secretly blamed Simon, who had landed the client. But he hated conflict, so he began to spend time out of the
						office, saying he was working on a new business strategy for the company.<P>

						<H2>And turf wars in their biggest client</H2>

						Then their biggest client refused to pay a sizeable invoice. The client-side group that had requested additional work on
						a project, hadn't cleared it with the group that was funding the project. Turf wars between these two groups held up the
						invoice for three months. Simon was furious, and let Jim know it (at least, as often as Jim appeared at the office).
						After all, the project manager on this project reported to Jim; he should've protected the project manager from the
						client's bullying.<P>

						<H2>Simon calls me for help</H2>

						Simon's wife had been at a training I had done at the company where she was working. She had learned tangible
						communication tools for improving her own productivity at work. She could tell I understood IT people, and since Simon
						was totally frustrated with Jim, someone who could understand Jim sounded like a good idea. Simon gave me a call, and
						eventually Jim and he agreed to bring me in for a problem-solving session.<P>

						<H2>I lead Jim and Simon in a problem-solving session</H2>

						We started with each of them telling me their perspective on what had been happening. Simon thought Jim was letting the
						power of being CEO go to his head. Jim wasn't his friend anymore. He wasn't doing any "real work," all he did was manage.
						And lately, he hadn't even been doing that.<P>

						When it was Jim's turn, he didn't say much. He wanted the company to get back on track. He thought Simon was emphasizing
						the "creative" part of his title and ignoring the "director" part.<P>

						I listed on a flip pad the key issues they would need to address: fine-tuning their business practices, communicating
						effectively, and mending their personal relationship. Which did they want to start with?<P>

						Simon had plenty of ideas, but the more he tried to persuade Jim what they should do, the more Jim closed down. Finally,
						silence. Simon turned to me. "See? He won't talk to me."<P>

						<H2>They each get time to vent (privately)</H2>

						I knew I had to get Jim talking, so I met privately with him first. I asked him if he liked programming, and if he missed
						it. That got him talking. He liked being CEO, but he was tired of trying to explain finances to Simon. Simon had been a
						jerk lately (only Jim didn't use the word "jerk"). He couldn't get anything done at work, people kept interrupting him. I
						worked with him on ways he could say "no" to Simon when necessary.<P>

						With Simon, I listened to him rant and rave. When I urged him to think about what was underlying his anger, he finally
						admitted he was having a hard time at home. His son was ill, and he and his wife were fighting over the best way
						to care for him. We worked on ways he could keep from venting his frustrations on Jim.<P>

						<H2>We set up a second session</H2>
						
						<p>Both Simon and Jim had given all the time to mediation that they could for that particular day. We set up a second session
						for a week later.</p>
						
						<p>While I don't give advice as a mediator, I do tell my clients about action steps that other clients have reported helped
						them succeed in a mediation. Simon and Jim each selected two of these action steps to complete before the next session.</p>
						
						<H2>Jim and Simon begin to reconcile</H2>

						<p>When we met for our second session, I asked Simon and Jim about their progress on the action steps they'd selected for
						themselves. Simon started out by apologizing to Jim for picking fights. Startled, Jim didn't know what to say. I asked
						Simon to elaborate. He said, "This is confidential, right?" I reminded him that it was. Simon looked at Jim and
						acknowledged that he'd made the mistake that led to the lawsuit.</p>

						I guided Jim and Simon in coming up with five concrete strategies to use to communicate better. Finally, Jim felt
						comfortable enough to acknowledge that he had, indeed, dropped the ball about the invoice.<P>

						He also felt comfortable enough to tell Simon bluntly that they had to spend money on certain things that Simon felt were
						a waste of money &#8211; consulting with their lawyer more often was one of them! They came up with five concrete ways to improve
						their business practices.<P>

						<H2>They start mending their friendship, and their company</H2>

						At the end, I asked them if there had been something they liked to do together that they hadn't done in a while. They
						thought for a while, then Simon mentioned a video game they used to play. All right, I said, pick a time every week to
						play that video game for half an hour. They decided on Thursdays at 6:00.<P>

						<H2>And the future looks bright</H2>

						I checked in with Simon and Jim a month later. Jim had been firm with the client about the unpaid invoice, insisting that
						they pay a late penalty &#8211; and they did. Simon and Jim were communicating better, and had already dealt with another minor legal
						issue before it became a problem. Their weekly video-game sessions gave them space to re-connect and work on their
						personal and business relationship. The venture capital firm was still interested in investing. The company's bright
						beginning was once again heading towards a bright future.<P>
