						<p>Danny worked in the IT department of a convention-planning company. He'd had ideas in the past for useful apps they
						could develop for their clients, apps that would be fun to develop. But he'd been frustrated because his management never
						understood how good these apps could be for the company.</p>
						
						<p>Now he had another idea, even better than the previous ones. Was it worth it for him to try one more time to present
						an idea to management?</p>

						<h2>The IT Geek hears about Short-Term Coaching in Communication</h2>

						<p>One day when his team went out to lunch, Danny was complaining about how management never listened to him. A team member
						mentioned that he had had a training with me at the company he worked for previously. He'd gotten concrete techniques for
						communicating effectively to non-IT people. He knew that I also worked with people individually.</p>

						<p>So Danny texted me. After I texted back about my services and how I could help him, we set up
						three phone sessions for him over the next three weeks. Because he wanted to get results quickly, I sent him some
						questions to think about before our first session.</p>

						<h2>I Coach Him on Communicating to Management</h2>

						<p>Over our three sessions, I encouraged him to see the language and terminology that business and marketing use, not as
						"jargon" or "meaningless," but as a foreign language that he could learn and communicate in. I worked with him on
						understanding successful strategies for communicating with people who need to persuade others in terms of ROI and value
						to customer. And I gave him techniques he could use to feel comfortable speaking in front of groups of people.</p>

						<p>During each session, we created a strategy for him for the coming week, to practice his new skills in low-risk situations: in project
						meetings, with his manager, even in his life outside of work. Then at our next session, we analyzed the results, and refined
						his strategy.</p>

						<p>At our last session, we reviewed Danny's plan for his pitch.  He practiced it with me, and I gave him a few final pointers.<p>
						
						<p>Danny felt ready to pitch his idea.</p>

						<h2>The Results</h2>

						<p>A week later, I got a text from Danny. His pitch meeting had gone well, and the CIO was considering his
						recommendation for developing the app.</>

						<p>A month later, Danny sent me an excited text. The CIO loved his idea and understood the benefit Danny had been able
						to communicate. Danny's team would be working on the new app as soon as they delivered their current project. He
						would be getting a bonus! And, just as important to him as an IT geek, he would be able to work on a project he was
						excited about.</p>
