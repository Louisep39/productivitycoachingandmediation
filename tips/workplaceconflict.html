						<H1>Ten Tips for Making Workplace Conflict Easier to Deal With</H1>

						<OL>
						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Create a concrete process, don't leave it to
						chance.</span><BR>
						Develop a set of steps for resolving conflict that you can use well and that are effective for you. By
						using these consistently, you'll use your time efficiently and effectively, set expectations for your team, and avoid the
						appearance of favoritism.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Learn from other people's conflicts by practicing.</span><BR>
						Think about conflicts you have had, and how your perspective changed as you learned more about the other person's point
						of view. Observe conflicts between other people. Learn to see how the same event can be viewed multiple ways, and you'll
						gain perspective that will help you solve conflicts more quickly.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Deal with conflict when it arises.</span><BR>
						Resolve conflict quickly, and avoid the problems that conflict causes in the workplace: time in dealing with unhappy team
						members, missed deadlines, absenteeism, poor quality of work, and ineffective teamwork. To calculate the cost of conflict
						to your team, go to <A HREF="http://img.en25.com/Web/CPP/Conflict_report.pdf" TARGET="_blank">Workplace Conflict and How
						Businesses can Harness it to Thrive</A></li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Blame yourself.</span><BR>
						No, really. Just for a second. Imagine, for a moment, that you are contributing to the problem. If it's true, change your
						own behavior and reduce your stress from conflict. Then forgive yourself and move on.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Reward yourself for dealing with difficult people.</span><BR>
						You get demands from all sides &#8212; your team, your managers, C-suite, the clients. When you have to have a difficult
						conversation with someone, or a conversation with a difficult person, decide on a reward you'll give yourself when the
						conversation is over. Then give it to yourself, even if the conversation wasn't as difficult as you thought it would
						be.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Create your own mental space and perspective.</span><BR>
						Avoid triggering the "fight or flight" response with techniques that allow you to see other people's actions towards you
						as not personal. For example, imagine the other person as a localized natural disaster, such as a tornado or
						thunderstorm, that is only around that person and from which you are completely safe.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Don't be the "pointy haired manager" from Dilbert.</span><BR>
						If someone is afraid of you, they will be harder to work with. The team member who seems like a problem may be unhappy,
						or scared of speaking up.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Build productivity, not rapport.</span><BR>
						You may never get along with some people. Find a way to work with them, and don't worry if you never find them
						likeable.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Learn a foreign language.</span><BR>
						If you have a hard time understanding your team members, do a quick Web search for basic
						information about their job. Eliminate bafflement and frustration by speaking their language.</li>

						<li class="tips-list"> <span class="tips-list-item-header">Imagine that you're fine, it's your environment that's the
						problem.</span><BR>
						Promoting effective conflict resolution within the entire organization will make conflicts within
						your team easier to deal with. Talk to upper management about the time and money that can be saved by dealing with
						conflict efficiently. For more information on how to calculate the costs of conflict in an organization, go to <A
						HREF="http://www.lawmemo.com/articles/measuring.htm" TARGET="_blank">Measuring Conflict: Both The Hidden Costs and the
						Benefits of Conflict Management Interventions</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.mediationworks.com/dmi/toolbox.htm"
						TARGET="_blank">Conflict Management Toolbox</A></li>
