<H1>Article: The Simple, All-Purpose Technique to Respond to Rudeness, Manipulation, Bullying, Etc.</H1>

			<H2>When Someone's so Horrible You Don't Know What to Do</H2>

			You know those times <B>when someone says something horrible</B> to you? It could be in a meeting, at a code review, on a phone call
			with a client, in the break room, even at lunch off site. Someone says something manipulative, bullying, rude, that leaves you
			speechless.<P>
			
			It's so bad, and so unexpected, <B>you don't know what to say or do</B>. Maybe you've practiced how to respond &#8212; such as using
			"I messages," saying "That sounded rude, was that really what you meant?" &#8212; but you forget everything you've practiced.<P>

			<B>Here's something easy and simple</B> to do. Which is good, because when you are in that "fight or flight" mode, easy and simple
			are best. What's more, it's something <B>that works in pretty much all situations</B>, no matter what the other person has said.<P>

			<H2>The Technique &#8212; Here's What You Do</H2>
			
			<OL>
			<LI><B>Look at the person.</B><BR>
			Let a couple seconds go by. It might feel like forever, but that's all right.</LI><BR>

			<LI><B>Say something like "Um... what?"</B><BR>
			Some other options:
			
			<UL>
			<LI>"Excuse me?"</LI>
			<LI>"What was that?"</LI>
			<LI>"Do what, now?"</LI>
			<LI>"What was your purpose in saying that?"
			</UL>
			
			Or whatever comes naturally to you. Say it <B>in a neutral tone of voice</B>, at least, as neutral as you can.</LI><BR>

			<LI><B>Look at the person some more.</B><BR>
			Again, it might feel like forever, but wait <B>about three times as long</B> as you think
			you should.</LI><BR>

			<LI><B>Then move on.</B><BR>
			Either you'll think of something to say, the other person will change the subject or apologize, or you'll
			find a way to leave the meeting or end the conversation.</LI>
			</OL>

			<H2>Let the Other Person feel Guilty, Buy Yourself Time</H2>
			
			The beauty of this technique is that you <B>let the other person's conscience do the work</B>. They know they've said something
			manipulative, that they're being a bully, that they're being rude, or that they're trying to shut you up. By using this technique,
			you <B>give the other person time to feel guilty</B>.<P>

			Even if the other person doesn't feel guilty, they'll notice that <B>you're not rising to the bait</B>. The less they get the
			reaction they want, the less likely they are to say something like this again.<P>

			<H2>And Figure Out What to do Next</H2>
			
			In either case, you <B>buy yourself some time</B> to think about what to do and figure out what to say. You know, the brilliant
			things you think of later on, after the meeting, or the code review, or whatever.<P>

			So, next time someone says something awful and you don't know what to do, use this easy technique. Look at the person, say "Um...
			what?", look at the person some more. Buy some time to let the other person feel guilty, and for you to think of <B>a safe and easy
			way to move on</B>.<P>
