<H1>Article: Facts are Facts, Right?</H1>

<DIV CLASS="callout"><B>A General Principle</B><p></p>If you have information to convey to someone, and the information is unqualified praise, you can give the information in front of others. Otherwise, whether you'll be distributing the information to others later or not, give the information in private. </DIV>

<B>Facts should just be facts, right?</B> Information is information, and it's value-neutral. Unfortunately, not everyone sees it that way. Some people &#8212; even <B>many people</B> &#8212; <B>see facts as reflecting on them personally</B>, even if the facts are simply given to them as information.<P>

<H2>The project manager sending out a weekly status e-mail</H2>

A programmer I know, who is so good at what he does that he was promoted to being <B>a project manager for technical development</B>, ran into the problem of people seeing facts as personal. Every week, he <B>would send out a summary of outstanding bugs and modules still checked out</B>.<P>

This is a reasonable e-mail to send out, right? And since these were just facts, given as information, he figured it would be all right if <B>he sent the e-mail to the entire team at</B> once.<P>

But some of his <B>team members weren't happy</B>. They thought <B>they were being called out</B> in front of the entire team.<P>

<H2>Before sending, he started pinging team members individually</H2>

A colleague of his suggested a different way to handle it. <B>He started sending out private e-mails, two days before the general e-mail</B>, to members of his team who still had outstanding bugs and modules checked out.<P>

Naturally, his team members knew whether they had bugs still to fix or modules they hadn't checked in. But <B>they were happier being reminded privately</B>. And they got an extra nudge to get bugs fixed and check their modules back in before the next weekly e-mail.<P>

<H2>Here's a general principle to follow</H2>

Of course, the right thing to do seems obvious when you're reading about it in the article like this one. So <B>what's the general principle</B> we can derive from this? Here's a first pass:

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>If you have information to convey to someone, and that information might seem negative to the person, give the information in private. If the information will at some point be distributed to a group of people, convey the information to the person before distribution. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you're thinking, "But it's not always clear in advance who's going to take something personally," that's a good point. When you're dealing with people, it's best to <B>err on the side of courtesy</B>. So here's <B>a second pass at a general principle:</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>If you have information to convey to someone, and the information is unqualified praise, you can give the information in front of others. Otherwise, whether you'll be distributing the information to others later or not, give the information in private. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>It will get easier</H2>

After a while, following this principle might seem tedious. But as you get to know your team, you get to know who can handle information given in front of others, and who can't.<P>

Meanwhile, <B>use the general principle</B> of how to convey facts and information, so they won't take it personally, and <B>you can tell people what you need them to know</B>.<P>
