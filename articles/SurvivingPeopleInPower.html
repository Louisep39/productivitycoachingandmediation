<H1>Article: Surviving People in Power in the Workplace</H1>

				We all have <B>horror stories about people</B> we've worked with. And the worst horror stories probably are about <B>people in positions of
				power in the workplace</B>. You might be living a horror story at work right now. Maybe:

				<UL>
				<LI>your boss is a bully</LI>
				<LI>the rules where you work are arcane and senseless</LI>
				<LI>upper management makes insanely stupid decisions</LI>
				<LI>the project manager is unreasonable</LI>
				</UL>

				If so, you're in a situation where <B>people in power make your life difficult</B>. Where the corporate culture is like a dictatorship,
				rather than a democracy.<P>

				<H2>You can't stand it, but you can't quit</H2>

				<B>You want to quit</B>, but you need the money, or the benefits, or both. You'd find another job, <B>but no one is hiring</B>.
				Even if people are hiring, they're only hiring people who are already working, which is another reason you can't quit. You know
				<B>you could run a company better</B>. But &#8212; especially in this economy &#8212; <B>starting your own business is risky</B>.<P>

				Meanwhile, <B>you're stressed, miserable, and angry</B>. You dread meetings with the bullying boss, you're running out of ways to
				be reasonable with the project manager, or you're avoiding upper management completely. You're <B>working insane hours</B> in an
				environment where <B>it's impossible to do a good job</B>.<P>

				<H2>What can you do?</H2>

				What makes the situation worse is that <B>you can't make the people in power change</B>. Maybe your boss is rewarded for being a
				bully, or the senseless rules seem reasonable to whoever made them, or upper management is out of touch, or your project manager
				won't stand up to the client.<P>

				You need to <B>get through this difficult time with your sanity intact</B>, until you can find another job, or a miracle occurs
				and the people in power get a clue. How can you do this?<P>

				<H2>Create something fun for yourself at work</H2>

				If the company structure is part of the problem, and the people in power won't change it, then you can help yourself keep your
				sanity if you <B>create an alternative, social structure</B> for yourself. (You'll also be helping yourself to start positive
				change in how the company is run &#8212; more on that later.)<P>

				Here's how to do it.

				<OL>
				<LI><B>Pick an activity you like</B>. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's something you genuinely like to do. Some examples:

				<UL>
				<LI>play video games</LI>
				<LI>read a book and discuss it</LI>
				<LI>play cards</LI>
				<LI>go skiing</LI>
				<LI>go out to dinner </LI>
				</UL>
				
				Pick <B>something you can do regularly</B>, like weekly or monthly or whatever.
				<P>

				<LI>Then, <B>find other people</B> in the company <B>who also like the activity</B>. You may already know some people who'd like
				to participate, and those people will probably know others. They can be people within your own team, but ideally, get people from
				other teams and <B>from different parts of the company</B>.</LI>
				<P>

				<LI><B>Run the group the way you wish the company was run</B>. You don't need a formal structure for the group; just make sure
				that whatever decisions the group needs to make, you <B>make the decisions democratically</B>. For example, if your group plays
				videogames, take turns deciding what you're going to play. If your group discusses books, have different person lead the
				discussion each time.</LI> </OL>

				As much as you can, <B>don't talk about work</B>. Yes, everyone wants to complain, including you. But the point of the group is
				to do something you enjoy.<P>

				<H2>And give yourself an alternative power structure</H2>

				Okay, it's not really an alternative power structure. But studies show that <B>people who have good experiences in something are
				more likely to have good experiences in the future</B>. If you give yourself experiences with a group that's enjoyable and run
				well, you're more likely to <B>have an enjoyable, well-run work atmosphere</B>, because you will (unconsciously) be creating it.<P>

				<H2>If you want, you can start a revolution</H2>

				Eventually, you can <B>create enough connections</B> within the company, and give enough people experience with a well-run group,
				that you can <B>start changing the company</B> for the better. Think of it as an underground movement to non-violently change the
				government, only the company is the government.<P>

				If you don't want to go that far, you don't have to. The main point of doing this is to help you in a difficult work situation.<P>

				<H2>Help yourself survive the people in power</H2>

				Create this social structure to help you <B>survive the people in power</B>. When the economy gets better, you'll be well positioned to
				look for another job. In the meantime, you might start a revolution what will <B>change the company for the better</B>, and maybe you
				won't want to leave after all.<P>
				<BR>
