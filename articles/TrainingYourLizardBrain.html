<H1>Article: Difficult Conversations: Retrain Your Lizard Brain and Enjoy Difficult Conversations (or at least not Dread Them)</H1>

You have to <B>have a conversation with someone at work</B>. Maybe the person is:
<UL>
<LI>a boss who's a bully</LI>
<LI>a team member whose work isn't to spec</LI>
<LI>a client who's pushing you to cram four months of work into four weeks (or four days) </LI>
</UL>
You've <B>prepared for this conversation</B>, using all of the how-to's and tips you've found on line or in books. But <B>time goes by</B>. The situation is <B>spoiling your mood</B>, <B>reducing your productivity</B>, completely <B>taking the fun out</B> of solving intriguing, complex problems. <B>Why haven't you had this conversation</B> that you know how to have?<P>
It's because <B>you haven't taken care of your lizard brain</B>. Yes, we all know there's really no such thing as a "lizard brain." But there is a part of your mind that needs something besides the preparation you've done. <B>It needs an experience</B>.<P>
Here's what you need to do for your lizard brain.
<OL>
<LI>Put on your rose-colored glasses. </LI>
<LI>Disguise yourself. </LI>
<LI>Cast a spell on the other person. </LI>
<LI>Promise yourself a reward. Then give yourself the reward. </LI>
</OL>
Let's take each of these in turn.

<H2>1. Put on your rose-colored glasses.</H2>

If you're not looking forward to this conversation, chances are your <B>conversations with this person haven't gone well</B> in the past. The thing is, having <B>a lot of difficult experiences primes you</B>, subconsciously, to have a bad experience again.<P>
You can <B>create a good "experience" </B> for yourself <B>by imagining a good outcome</B>. Studies show that simply imagining a good experience of a particular activity helps you have good experiences with that activity. (I'll cite some articles at the end, if you're interested in looking at the original research.)<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">Imagine the best possible outcome</SPAN><BR>
Allow yourself about 10 minutes (the studies on imagining the best possible outcome suggest 30 minutes; if you have that much spare time, great). First, <B>imagine yourself in a future</B> in which the conversation has had <B>the best outcome</B> it possibly could. You <B>planned what you would say</B>, you <B>took care of your lizard brain</B> in all the ways that we're talking about here, you <B>accomplished everything</B> you wanted to in the conversation.<P>
Being <B>as specific and vivid as possible</B>, write down everything that would be true in the best possible outcome.<P>
By imagining a good experience with this conversation, you'll <B>prime yourself to have a good conversation</B>.<P>

<H2>2. Disguise yourself.</H2>

So, what do you do <B>if the person</B> you need have this conversation with <B>intimidates </B>you, <B>annoys </B>you, or <B>patronizes</B> you? Or, at the other end of the scale, the other person <B>clams up</B>, <B>complains that you're "arguing," </B> or even <B>starts crying</B>?<P>
Give your lizard brain <B>a positive image of yourself</B> that it can re-create during the conversation.<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">If the other person is scary, a bully, or intimidating...</SPAN><BR>
Imagine yourself as someone, or something, that's <B>impervious to whatever the person does</B> For example:
<UL>
<LI>you have an adamantium spine</LI>
<LI>you're a shape shifter</LI>
<LI>you're a mountain</LI>
</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">If the other person is nicey nicey or passive aggressive...</SPAN><BR>
Imagine that you're <B>something dangerous</B>, so you unconsciously won't overwhelm them. For example:
<UL>
<LI>you're a hurricane</LI>
<LI>you have wolverine claws</LI>
<LI>you're Rogue (or another comic book hero) </LI>
</UL>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">Either way...</SPAN><BR>
Whatever you choose, <B>spend some time imagining yourself</B> as that someone or something. <B>What attributes</B> does that thing have? What <B>adjectives</B> would you use to describe it? What <B>kind of "body" </B> does it have?
By creating a positive image of yourself, you'll give your lizard brain something it can use to <B>help you stick with your plan for the conversation</B>.

<H2>3. Cast a spell on the other person. </H2>

Another way to get your lizard brain on your side is to <B>mentally transform the other person</B> into something that can't affect you:
<UL>
<LI>a small, <B>localized weather phenomenon or natural disaster</B>; for example, a thundercloud over the person's head, a campfire, or a geyser.</LI>
<LI>some of <B>harmless creature</B>; for example, a dog barking, a bird chirping or cawing, or a squirrel chattering.</LI>
<LI>a <B>mechanical device</B>; for example, a benign video game, a DVD spinning in a drive, or a leaf blower.</LI>
</UL>
Be sure to choose something that your lizard brain won't find disturbing or scary, or ridiculous.<P>
By creating a harmless image of the other person, you'll help your lizard brain <B>diminish the other person</B> into something you can <B>talk with productively</B>.

<H2>4. Promise yourself a reward. Then give it to yourself. </H2>

The last thing you do for your lizard brain, before you have that difficult conversation, is to promise yourself a reward for afterwards. This can be <B>anything you can easily do right after the conversation</B>:
<UL>
<LI>play your favorite video game for a while</LI>
<LI>enjoy some gourmet chocolate</LI>
<LI>go out for a drink</LI>
</UL>
Then, after the conversation, <B>give yourself the reward, even if the conversation wasn't as hard</B> as you thought it would be.<P>
By doing this, you'll get your lizard brain to <B>associate good things with having difficult conversations</B>.<P>

<H2>This may sound "woo woo," but it works. </H2>

When you're better able to have difficult conversations, you'll be better able to
<UL>
<LI>stand up to the bullying boss</LI>
<LI>get your team members to stay productive, and</LI>
<LI>manage your client's demands</LI>
</UL>
Your <B>mood will improve</B>, your <B>productivity will increase</B>, and you'll <B>enjoy your job more. </B><P>
So take care of your lizard brain, and your lizard brain will take care of you. It will help you remember and use all of the tips and "how-to's" you've learned and practiced for <B>having difficult conversations, and succeeding</B>.
