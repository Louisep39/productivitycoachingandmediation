<H1>Living with an Agreement Afterwards</H1>

<B>When you're in the middle of a conflict</B>, it's easy to forget about what will happen afterwards. You may be thinking about coming to an agreement to resolve the conflict, but you should also <B>think about how you will live with the agreement</B> in the days, months, and even years to come.<P>

<H2>Punishing Someone isn't a Good Idea</H2>

In mediation, <B>I often see one person punishing another person.</B> They'll say that if the other person doesn't do something that's been agreed to, then the other person has to do something really big or burdensome &#8212; pay a penalty fee, for example. This usually derails the mediation (no surprise there). But also, <B>punishing the other person may make you feel bad later on.</B><P>

<H2>Here's an Example of Why</H2>

Let me give you an example. Since mediations are confidential, <B>I'll give you an example about me</B>.<P>

<B>Years ago, I paid some expenses on behalf of someone</B> I was working with. I'll call her Peggy. We agreed on things Peggy could do that would raise the money to pay me back. <B>Then she told me she wasn't going to pay me back</B>, that she hadn't agreed to.<P>

I was angry, and not just about the money. I felt that she'd taken advantage of my generosity. <B>I wanted to sue her in small claims court</B> for the entire amount, even though I knew she wouldn't be able to pay it back all at once.<P>

Instead, I contacted Peggy, and we started talking. <B>We worked out a payment plan she could manage</B>, and she made the payments on time; in fact, she even finished paying it off early.<P>

<B>I've always been happy about this</B>, about how we resolved our dispute. I have to live with myself, and <B>punishing someone isn't according to my values</B>. I would've always regretted it.<P>

<H2>You Have to Live with Yourself Afterwards</H2>

So next time you are resolving a conflict, <B>make sure you have an agreement that you won't feel bad about later on</B>. You have to live with yourself even after the agreement has been fulfilled.<P>
