<H1>Article: Effective Project Delegation to your IT Team</H1>

<B>IT people can be hard to manage</B> (I can say this because I am an IT person). On the plus side, <B>they're logical</B>,<B> detail minded</B>, and<B> focused</B>. This makes them good at what they do. It also can make them seem<B> inflexible</B>,<B> fussy</B> about details, and<B> hard to keep on task</B> (they'll work 24 hours straight and something that intrigues them, but insist on doing "good work" at the expense of meeting deadlines).<P>

You need to be able to <B>get from your team what you need</B>, when you need it by, to <B>please the clients</B> and <B>make your managers happy</B> &#8212; and to <B>get satisfaction out of your job</B>. One of the things you need to be able to do when managing IT people is <B>delegate effectively</B>.<P>

<H2>Here's a Method for Delegating to IT People</H2>

There are <B>four steps in delegating</B> to IT people:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Tell them what you need.</LI>
<LI>Tell them when you need it by.</LI>
<LI>Give them what they need to do the job.</LI>
<LI>Let them get the job done.</LI>
</OL>

Let's talk about each of these steps.<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">1) Tell them what you need.</SPAN><P>

We've all had this experience: <B>sometimes your team member doesn't deliver what the client asked for</B>. That leads to unhappy clients, cost overruns, and slipped schedules.<P>

The first step in effectively delegating to IT people is to tell them exactly what you need from them. Since IT people are typically logical and detail-oriented, you need to <B>describe what you need systematically and specifically</B>.<P>

<B>For example</B>, let's suppose you're managing a team <B>developing a mobile app</B>. The client has just told you they want one sequence of screens split into two separate paths through the app. You need to delegate this task to one of your programmers.<P>

Tell the programmer <B>exactly what content the new screens should have</B>, and <B>exactly what their functionality should be</B>. Provide all of the information you got from the client.<P>

Make sure you <B>give your team member enough details</B>. Let your team member ask for any specifics that they need. You may need to go back to the client for this, and that'll take time. But the good news is, <B>the more you manage IT people</B>, the more you'll know what kinds of specifics they need, and <B>the easier it will be </B>to give them enough details.<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">2) Tell them when you need it by.</SPAN><P>

Just as we've all had the experience of getting a deliverable that's not what the client asked for, we also know that <B>sometimes your team member delivers late</B>.<P>

The second step in effectively delegating to IT people is to <B>tell them exactly what the deadline is</B>.<P>

<B>For example</B>, the deadline might be "<B>on my desk tomorrow by 10:00 a.m.</B>," or "<B>e-mailed by the 20th at 2:30 p.m.</B>," or "<B>on the server Friday COB</B>" (assuming you have a common understanding of what time "COB" actually is).<P>

Make sure you <B>don't just say that the deadline is "ASAP."</B> The problem with "as soon as possible" is that <B>it can mean many things</B>. It might mean "drop everything else and work only on this as fast as you can until it's finished." It might mean "I need what ever you can give me by 5:00 this afternoon." It might mean "do your most urgent work before you tackle this, and then work on this as fast as you can until you're finished." Rather than saying that the deadline is ASAP, <B>say exactly what you mean by "ASAP</B>".<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">3) Give them what they need to do the job.</SPAN><P>

We all know what happens sometimes your team member doesn't have what they need to do the job. They don't do it on time, and they don't do it spec.<P>

So, the third step in effectively delegating to IT people is to<B> give them everything they need</B> to do the job you're assigning them.<P>

For example, your team member will need everything you've received<B> from the client</B>: descriptions, sketches, specifications. They'll also need everything that might come<B> from other members of your team</B>: copy, wireframes, test data.<P>

Make sure you<B> check in with them</B> periodically. They might not figure out until halfway through the work that there's something more they need. So<B> see if they've discovered new needs</B>, and if they have, get them what they need. And<B> make a note</B> of these needs<B> for next time</B>, so you can get them met right away.<P>

<SPAN CLASS="header3">4) Let them get the job done.</SPAN><P>

You know that if your client or manager hovers, you have a harder time getting your work done. Thing is, you may be doing this to your team member without knowing it.<B> Sometimes your team member needs to be left alone</B>.<P>

The fourth and last step in delegating to IT people is to<B> let your team member get the job done</B>.<P>

For example, <B>your team member might need quiet</B>, or long stretches of<B> time to work without interruption,</B> or<B> reprioritizing of other tasks</B>. You might not always be able to give your team member all of these things, but do what you can. Ask for progress reports, and check in with them periodically, as I talked about in step (3).<P>

Make sure you<B> ask for reasonable progress reports</B>. What's "reasonable?" For a small job with a really tight deadline, that might mean twice a day. For a big job with a deadline months out, that might be weekly. Make sure that providing progress reports doesn't take up more time than the benefit they provide. Basically, this is code for "don't hover."<P>

<H2>This Method of Delegating gets You What You Need</H2>

As you're thinking about what you've read here, <B>it may seem rigid, fussy, or excessively detailed</B>. If you're not used to delegating this way, that's <B>a totally normal reaction</B>. But as you use it, you'll find <B>it gets easier with time</B>.<P>

Remember what you know about IT people. They're logical, detail minded, and focused. <B>To get from your team what you need</B>, you have to <B>give them what <I>they</I> need</B>. If you do that, the <B>clients will be pleased</B>, <B>your managers will be happy</B>, and <B>you'll be more satisfied with your job</B>.<P>
